Objective

Process product images of sneakers and ankle boots from Zalando.com. Every row consists of a label, being either 0 for a sneaker or 1 for an
ankle boot, and 28x28 8-bit grayscale pixel values of the product image.

The goal of this assignment is to evaluate and optimise the performance of different classifiers for their suitability to classify this dataset.
